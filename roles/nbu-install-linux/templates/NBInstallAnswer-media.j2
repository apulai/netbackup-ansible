# This answer file template contains values that may be used for unattended/silent
# installs and upgrades of media servers. To utilize this template, create a copy
# at /tmp/NBInstallAnswer.conf and set environment-specific values for the required
# options. The other options may be set or removed as needed.  Unused options
# should be removed from the file.  Default values will be used for options that
# are not present in the file.
#
# Host names that are provided for any these options must be resolvable.
# It is best practice to use fully-qualified domain names.
#
# Do not attempt to change existing configuration settings via this file during
# upgrades.  Attempting to do so may result in ignored specifications or failed
# upgrades.
#
# The primary use of this file is with native installs and upgrades.  The NetBackup
# install script may honor specific documented options.

CLIENT_NAME = XLOCALHOSTX
#    Description: This option specifies the name that NetBackup uses to identify
#                 this machine. The XLOCALHOSTX value lets the local host provide
#                 the machine name. If this value is used, it may be possible to use
#                 the same answer file on all machines within a single master server
#                 domain. This value is added to the bp.conf file.
#    Default value: N/A
#    Required for initial install: Yes
#    Required for upgrade: If provided, the value must match the current value
#                          stored in the CLIENT_NAME field in bp.conf.

MACHINE_ROLE = MEDIA
#    Description: This option specifies the NetBackup role to install and configure
#                 on this machine.
#    Default value: N/A
#    Required for initial install: Yes
#    Required for upgrade: If provided, this value must match the configured
#                          role on the machine.

SERVER = {{ master_server }}
#    Description: This option specifies the server name this machine recognizes as
#                 the current NetBackup master server.  Additional SERVER= lines may
#                 be added if there are other servers that should be recognized.
#                 In the case where multiple SERVER= lines are present, the first
#                 occurrence is the master server.  These entries are added to the
#                 bp.conf file.
#    Default value: N/A
#    Required for initial install: Yes
#    Required for upgrade: If provided, this value must match the first SERVER
#                          entry in bp.conf.

INSTALL_PATH = /usr
#    Description: This option specifies the location to install the NetBackup binaries.
#                 Only the absolute path to a base directory is required for this option.
#                 The installer will automatically append /openv.
#    Default Value: /usr
#    Required for initial install: No
#    Required for upgrade: This option will be ignored.  The install path cannot be
#                          changed during an upgrade.

LICENSE = {{ nbu_license_key }}
#    Description: This option specifies the license key string to apply to the server.
#                 Additional "LICENSE = key" lines may be added if more licenses are to be
#                 applied.  This option only adds additional keys - no existing keys are
#                 removed.
#    Default Value: N/A
#    Required for initial install: Yes
#    Required for upgrade: No - provide if needed

INCLUDE_JAVA_GUI_AND_JRE = MATCH
#    Description: Installation of the NetBackup Java GUI and JRE packages is now optional.
#                 This option specifies whether the Java GUI and JRE packages should be
#                 installed, upgraded, or removed.
#                 The supported values are:
#                     MATCH   = Match the existing configuration on the host.  Specifying
#                               this value for an initial install will not install these
#                               packages.
#                     INCLUDE = Include the Java GUI and JRE packages when installing or
#                               upgrading NetBackup.
#                     EXCLUDE = Exclude the Java GUI and JRE packages when installing or
#                               upgrading NetBackup.  Any preexisting NetBackup Java GUI
#                               and JRE packages will be removed.
#    Default Value: N/A
#    Required for initial install: No
#    Required for upgrade: No

# Security configuration: If this is an initial installation or an upgrade from pre-NetBackup
#                         8.0, at least one set of security configuration parameters (NBCA or
#                         ECA) must be provided.
#
#                         If the master server is using a NetBackup certificate authority (NBCA)
#                         only, this host must also use NBCA. In this case, the
#                         CA_CERTIFICATE_FINGERPRINT of the master server must be provided.
#                         An AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN may also be required depending on the
#                         security level configured on the master server or whether this
#                         machine is already configured on the master.  For more information
#                         refer to:
#                         https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/article.000127129.
#
#                         If the master server is using an external certificate authority (ECA),
#                         or if the master server is using both NBCA and ECA, this host must
#                         use ECA. In this case the ECA_CERT_PATH, ECA_CRL_CHECK_LEVEL,
#                         ECA_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH, and ECA_TRUST_STORE_PATH values are required.
#                         The ECA_CRL_PATH is required only when ECA_CRL_CHECK_LEVEL=USE_PATH.
#                         The ECA_KEY_PASSPHRASEFILE value is optional.
#                         For more information, refer to:
#                         https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/article.100044300.
#
#                         If this is an initial install or an upgrade from NetBackup 8.0
#                         or later security may already be set correctly.  If the master
#                         server is using only NBCA or only ECA, and the media server is
#                         already configured to use those methods, the security options
#                         are not required and will be ignored if provided.  If the master
#                         server is using ECA and the media server is not, ECA options
#                         must be provided.

CA_CERTIFICATE_FINGERPRINT = {{ master_ca_cert }}

#    Description: Applicable only if the master server is using only a NetBackup certificate
#                 authority, and not an external certificate authority.
#                 This option specifies the Certificate Authority (CA) Certificate Fingerprint.
#                 The Certificate Fingerprint is retrieved from the CA during installation or
#                 upgrade. The fingerprint format is 59 characters and is a combination of the
#                 digits 0-9, the letters A-F, and colons (for example,
#                 01:23:45:67:89:AB:CD:EF:01:23:45:67:89:AB:CD:EF:01:23:45:67). The fingerprint
#                 value must match the fingerprint for the server value that is specified in
#                 the first SERVER=server_name option. Set this to SKIP to continue the
#                 installation or upgrade without configuring the host to use a NetBackup
#                 certificate authority.
#    Default Value: N/A
#    Required for initial install: See Security configuration note above.
#    Required for upgrade: See Security configuration note above.

AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN = {{ auth_token }}
#    Description: Applicable only if the master server is using only a NetBackup certificate
#                 authority, and not an external certificate authority.
#                 This option specifies that NetBackup should use an authorization or a
#                 reissue token when retrieving the host certificate. The AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN
#                 is 16 upper case letters. Some environments require an authorization token
#                 for backups and restores to work correctly. If this information is required
#                 and is not provided in the answer file, the installation will fail. If SKIP
#                 is specified, the installer attempts to retrieve a host certificate without
#                 including a token. In some environments this may result in additional manual
#                 steps following the installation.
#    Default Value: N/A
#    Required for initial install: See Security configuration note above.
#    Required for upgrade: See Security configuration note above.

ECA_CERT_PATH = SKIP
#    Description: Applicable only if the master server is using an external certificate 
#                 authority.
#                 This option specifies the path and the file name of the external certificate
#                 file. Set this and all ECA properties to SKIP to continue installation or
#                 upgrade without configuring the host to use an external certificate authority.
#    Default Value: N/A
#    Required for initial install: See Security configuration note above.
#    Required for upgrade: See Security configuration note above.

ECA_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH = SKIP
#    Description: Applicable only if the master server is using an external certificate 
#                 authority.
#                 This option specifies the path and the file name of the file representing the
#                 private key. Set this and all ECA properties to SKIP to continue installation
#                 or upgrade without configuring the host to use an external certificate
#                 authority.
#    Default Value: N/A
#    Required for initial install: See Security configuration note above.
#    Required for upgrade: See Security configuration note above.

ECA_TRUST_STORE_PATH = SKIP
#    Description: Applicable only if the master server is using an external certificate 
#                 authority.
#                 This option specifies the path and the file name of the file representing the
#                 trust store location. Set this and all ECA properties to SKIP to continue
#                 installation or upgrade without configuring the host to use an external
#                 certificate authority.
#    Default Value: N/A
#    Required for initial install: See Security configuration note above.
#    Required for upgrade: See Security configuration note above.

ECA_CRL_CHECK_LEVEL = SKIP
#    Description: Applicable only if the master server is using an external certificate 
#                 authority.
#                 This option specifies the CRL mode. Supported values are:
#                 USE_CDP: Use the CRL defined in the certificate.
#                 USE_PATH: Use the CRL at the path that is specified in ECA_CRL_PATH.
#                 DISABLED: Do not use a CRL.
#                 SKIP: Set this and all ECA properties to SKIP to continue installation
#                       or upgrade without configuring the host to use an external
#                       certificate authority.
#    Default Value: N/A
#    Required for initial install: See Security configuration note above.
#    Required for upgrade: See Security configuration note above.

ECA_CRL_PATH = SKIP
#    Description: Applicable only if the master server is using an external certificate 
#                 authority.
#                 This option specifies the path and the file name of the CRL associated with
#                 the external CA certificate. Set this and all ECA properties to SKIP to
#                 continue installation or upgrade without configuring the host to use an
#                 external certificate authority.
#    Default Value: N/A
#    Required for initial install: Only when ECA_CRL_CHECK_LEVEL=USE_PATH
#    Required for upgrade: Only when ECA_CRL_CHECK_LEVEL=USE_PATH

ECA_KEY_PASSPHRASEFILE = SKIP
#    Description: Applicable only if the master server is using an external certificate 
#                 authority.
#                 This option specifies the path and the file name of the file that contains
#                 the passphrase to access the keystore. Set this and all ECA properties to 
#                 SKIP to continue installation or upgrade without configuring the host to use
#                 an external certificate authority.
#    Default Value: N/A
#    Required for initial install: No
#    Required for upgrade: No
