## Assumptions

 - To utilize this role, in-depth knowledge of both Veritas NetBackup and Ansible is required.
 - To use these roles in your own environment, the roles/playbooks may require some small modifications.

## How to use this project

To use this project 

    1. Clone the repository from GitHub and move to your Ansible Control Host:
 
         git clone https://github.com/VeritasOS/netbackup-ansible.git

	2. Experiment with the different roles on a test environment:

		 More information on how to use each role provided in the role README.md file
		 
		 Note - Small modifications may be required to the Ansible Role to get them to run in your environment

## Development Environment

This section provides details of the development environment used to develop these sample Ansible roles/playbooks.

### Overview

These sample Ansible roles/playbooks were developed with the following test environment:

| Description | Product / Version | 
| :--- | :--- |
| Server Platform | RedHat 8.4 - Master / Media / Linux Client |
| | Windows 2019 - OpsCenter / Windows Client | 
| Configuration Management Tool | Ansible 2.9.x	|
| Configuration Management Orchrastration | Ansible Tower 17.x |
| Software Repository | Artifactory	|		
| Code Repository | GitHub |
| Development IDE | Visual Studio |																

### Software

#### Artifactory

All NetBackup software is stored in Artifactory:

![Screenshot](./img/artifactory_software.PNG)

#### GitHub/GitLab

All Ansible Code is stored in GitLab:

![Screenshot](./img/github_project.PNG)

#### Ansible Tower

Ansible Tower is used to orchastrate the running of playbooks / workflows and for secrets management. Within Ansible Tower:

1. Project has been added and syncrhorised
2. Custom Credential types have been created and relevant secrets have been configured
3. Templates have been created for the individual playbooks. The relevant credentials have been attached to the templates
4. Inventory(s) have been created

### VM Configuration

#### Local Facts

All NetBackup servers and client have local Ansible facts defined about the NetBackup environment - These facts are created when the Servers/Clients are provisioned and are leveraged by the various roles to determine information about the NetBackup domain. 

**Linux Severs:**

	The following facts defined in the local fact file ("/etc/ansible/facts.d/netbackup.fact"):

		Master Server

			[domain]
			name=<master_server_hostname>
			role=master
			truster_master=<remote_master_server_hostname or none>

		Media Server

			[domain]
			name=<master_server_hostname>
			role=media

		Client - Linux

			[domain]
			name=<master_server_hostname>
			role=client_linux

		CloudPoint

			[domain]
			name=<master_server_hostname>
			role=cloudpoint

**Windows Severs:**

	The following facts defined in the local fact file ("C:\.Ansible\netbackup.ps1"):

		Client - Windows

			@{
				domain = @{
				name = '<master_server_hostname>'
				role = 'client_windows'
				}
			}

		OpsCenter

			@{
				domain = @{
				name = '<master_server_hostname>'
				role = 'opscenter'
				}
			}


Note - All "nbu-install" roles have been developed using a dynamic inventory that is built at run time. Before a role is used, the inventory is built dynamically against all the hosts and the hosts are added to one of the following groups. This approach allows for the majority of roles to be run against inventories contains multiple NetBackup domains

	Groups
	  - master
	  - media
	  - client_linux
	  - client_windows
	  - opscenter
	  - cloudpoint
